# Error Logging Service Architecture

## Overview

I would build an error logging service with these main parts:

1. **JavaScript SDK** that developers add to their apps
2. **Node.js backend** to receive and store the errors
3. **Database** to keep all the error data
4. **React dashboard** where developers can see what's going wrong
5. **Cloud setup** to make sure everything runs smoothly

Here's a simple diagram of how it would all connect:

```
[Your Apps] → [Our SDK] → [API Server] → [Database]
                                ↑
                         [React Dashboard]
```

## Technology Choices

### 1. Client SDK

I'd build the SDK with **JavaScript** because:
- Works in both browsers and Node.js apps
- Easy for developers to install via npm
- Can automatically capture errors with window.onerror

Example of how developers would use it:
```javascript
// Simple to add to any app
import { logger } from 'error-logger';

// One line setup
logger.init('my-api-key');

// Or catch specific errors
try {
  // their code here
} catch (err) {
  logger.send(err);
}
```

### 2. Backend API

I'd use **Express.js on Node.js** because:
- JavaScript throughout makes development consistent
- Express is simple but powerful
- Easy to deploy and scale
- Good for handling many requests at once

The API would have these endpoints:
- `POST /api/logs` - Send new error logs
- `GET /api/logs` - Get error logs with filtering
- `POST /api/users` - Manage access to the dashboard

### 3. Database

I'd use **MongoDB** because:
- Flexible for storing different types of errors
- No need to define strict schemas upfront
- Good performance for write-heavy applications
- Simple to query for the dashboard

Data structure would look like:
```javascript
{
  timestamp: Date,
  application: String,
  errorMessage: String,
  stackTrace: String,
  browser: String,
  os: String,
  user: { id, email } // anonymous
}
```

### 4. Web Dashboard

I'd build the dashboard with **React** because:
- Component-based approach makes it easy to organize
- Lots of charts and table libraries available
- Fast rendering for large sets of error data
- Easy to add features like filters and search

Main dashboard features:
- List of recent errors with sorting
- Search by error message or other fields
- Charts showing error trends over time
- Email alerts for critical errors
- User management for team access

### 5. DevOps Solution

I'd deploy everything on **AWS** using:
- EC2 or ECS for the backend services
- MongoDB Atlas for the database
- S3 and CloudFront for the dashboard
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines

This gives us:
- Easy scaling when more users join
- Good monitoring of the entire system
- Simple deployment process

## Key Decisions

### Error Processing

- Store errors immediately so nothing gets lost
- Process details in the background for speed
- Group similar errors together to reduce noise
- Keep original error data for debugging

### Data Storage

- Keep detailed errors for 30 days
- Summarize older errors to save space
- Allow customers to download their data
- Make backups daily

### API Limits

- Limit to 100 errors per minute per app (adjustable)
- Queue excess errors during traffic spikes
- Provide clear error messages when limits are hit

### Security

- Require API keys for sending logs
- Use JWT tokens for dashboard access
- Encrypt sensitive data in logs

## Questions I'd Ask the Client

1. Do you need to store any sensitive information with errors?
2. How long do you need to keep error data?
3. Who will be using the dashboard (developers, managers, etc.)?
4. What are the most important things they need to see first?
5. Do you need integrations with Slack or other tools?
6. Should users be notified about new errors? How?
7. Do you need custom fields for your specific apps?
8. Do you need on-premise installation or is cloud OK?
